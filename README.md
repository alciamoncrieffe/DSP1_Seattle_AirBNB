# Seattle AirBNB

Data analysis of Seattle AirBNB property listing data, to answer real world questions.

## Installation

- Python 3.8.12
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - sklearn
    - seaborn

## Project Motivation

For this project, will be using Kaggle Seattle AirBNB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. Does the listing price vary for hosts with multiple listings compared to hosts with only 1 listing?
    1b. Are hosts with multiple listings concentrated in certain Seattle areas?
2.  Do renters prefer certain property features or amenities?
3.  Which factors contribute the most to Seattle's AirBNB property rental price?
    3b.  How well can we predict a property's rental price?

## File Descriptions

- `DSP1_Seattle_AirBNB_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the examination, manipulation and modelling of BNB data to answer the above questions.
- `airbnb_functions.py `- Supporting py file, containing functions to which will be called from the `DSP1_Seattle_AirBNB_Analysis.ipynb` as part of the data preparation process.
- The source Airbnb data required is available from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). To use with notebook, download the Kaggle data into a new folder `/Seattle_AirBND_Data/`
